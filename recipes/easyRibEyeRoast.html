    <h2>Homemade Easy Rib Eye Roast</h2>
    <p>
      I make this rib-eye roast on the bone every time rib eyes are on sale.
      Easy and delicious; there are never any leftovers! We usually cook ours
      medium-rare.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in rib-eye roast</li>
      <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Beat butter and garlic together in a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Poke several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all
        over meat and season with salt and pepper. Place rib eye fat-side up in
        a roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue cooking until
        rib eye is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 145 degrees
        F (63 degrees C) for medium.
      </li>
    </ol>
